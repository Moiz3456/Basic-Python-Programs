# Python-Programs
All the programs are taken from the website w3resource.com
Since all the outputs of the programs are below the program itself, much helpfull for all the beginners, to learn and understand the concepts 
and programs with different types.

Basic Understanding of python, more importantly learning the methods of list,strings, tuples, dictionaries and ability to handle conditional statements and loops will be helpfull in many ways.
Since the programs are in notebooks, one can just go through the files to recall the very basics of python.
